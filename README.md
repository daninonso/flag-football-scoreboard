# Flag Football Scoreboard

## Digital scoreboard that can be used for live score tracking of a flag football game

This project was built as part of a capstone project for an online front-end development course. It combines accumulated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge into this simple layout for tracking the touchdowns and extra points scored for both teams. The scoreboard has 4 major functionalities built on event listeners in the DOM, and JavaScript functions:

- +6 point button - adds 6 points to a specific team's total score
- +2 point button - adds 2 points to a team's total score for successful long extra point conversion
- +1 point button - adds 1 point to a team's total score for successful short extra point conversion
